Interactive Background with Dynamic Spiral Effect

User Story: 
As a website visitor,
I want the background of the portfolio webpage to interact with my mouse movements, creating a dynamic and visually engaging experience,
so that I feel intrigued and enjoy exploring the content of the portfolio.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Dynamic Background
The background contains "stars" that are distributed across the screen.
When the user moves the mouse, the stars respond by repositioning into a spiral pattern centered on the mouse pointer.

2. Mouse Tracking
The position of the spiral updates in real-time as the mouse moves across the screen.
The motion is smooth and responsive without noticeable lag.

3. Spiral Formation
Stars form a visually distinct spiral pattern with increasing radius and angles from the center point (mouse position).
The spiral dissipates and reforms as the user moves the mouse, maintaining an organic, fluid appearance.

4. Performance
The interaction does not cause the webpage to lag or become unresponsive.
Works consistently across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

5. Fallback
If the user's browser or device does not support the interactive feature, the background displays a static version of the stars.

6. Design
The stars should be aesthetically pleasing, blending with the overall theme of the portfolio.
The interaction should not obstruct or distract from the readability of foreground content.

7. Accessibility
The interactive background should not cause issues for users with motion sensitivity (provide an option to disable the effect).

8. Responsiveness
The dynamic background adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, maintaining the spiral effect across various devices.
